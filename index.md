# Welcome!

This humble corner of the internet is a collection of my undergraduate work thus far, ranging from coursework for classes such as ME 480: Mechatronics and Control Systems to my research on quadruped robots.

## Quadruped Robots

### Lafayette OpenDog

For me, this is where it all began. Inspired by James Bruton's [openDog](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwJoq86vov_PkA0bla0eiUTsCAPi_mZf), I collaborated with [Professor Alexander Brown](https://github.com/Alexanderallenbrown) and [Sanha Lee '20](https://github.com/sanhalee17) during the summer of 2019 to begin the development of a large-scale quadruped robot.

Sanha and the Lafayette OpenDog Senior Design Team continued this project over the 2019-2020 school year. To see their continued progress, check out their repository...

### MicroDog: A Low-Cost Quadruped Robot

Starting as an independent study in the spring of my junior year (2020), this project has slowly morphed into my senior thesis titled "Stepping Up: Investigating Dynamic Stability in a Low-Cost Quadruped Robot." Using a roughly $150, 6-inch tall robot designed by Professor Brown and myself, we are investigating methods of maintaining balance and navigating over stairs and uneven terrian on low-cost platforms. Currently, I am in the final stages of developing the fourth iteration of the robot and investigating ZMP control.

## 2021 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program

This past fall, I applied to the 2021 NSF GRFP. While my interests have shifted slightly away from human-robot interaction since I applied, my Graduate Research Plan Statement still reflects my ability to ..............
