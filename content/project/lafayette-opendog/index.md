title: Lafayette OpenDog
summary: For me, this is where it all began. Inspired by James Bruton's openDog, I collaborated with Professor Alexander Brown and Sanha Lee '20 during the summer of 2019 to begin the development of a large-scale quadruped robot.

For me, this is where it all began. Inspired by James Bruton's [openDog](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwJoq86vov_PkA0bla0eiUTsCAPi_mZf), I collaborated with [Professor Alexander Brown](https://github.com/Alexanderallenbrown) and [Sanha Lee '20](https://github.com/sanhalee17) during the summer of 2019 to begin the development of a large-scale quadruped robot. My resposibilities included investigating the literature to inform our hardware and software design, deriving the inverse kinematics model for the robot, developing Python scripts using ROS to interface with the motor controllers, implementing a simple walking mechanism on a single leg (as demonstrated below), and aiding my partner in some of the mechanical design and assembly.

Take a look at our GitHub repository, [opendog_ros](https://github.com/G-Conard/opendog_ros).

Sanha and the Lafayette OpenDog Senior Design Team continued this project over the 2019-2020 school year. To see their continued progress, check out the README file on opendog_ros for details about their repositories.
