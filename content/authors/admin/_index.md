I am a Robotics Engineering PhD Student in the Soft Robotics Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Naturally inquisitive about far too many things, my interests span a wide variety of applications of robotics and control systems engineering, including space exploration, assistive technology, and human-robot interaction, but they are all united by the common thread of modeling robot movement and locomotion. Thus far, my research has focused on exploring how to achieve more efficient, animal-like motions with robots, specifically through the modeling and control of an origami-inspired continuum spine that is impeded in our lab's quadruped robot and lizard-inspired robot.
